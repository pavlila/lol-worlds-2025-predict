# lol-worlds-2025-predict

This project aims to predict the outcome of the League of Legends World Championship based on match data from the entire 2025 season, sourced from [gol.gg](https://gol.gg/). Team statistics, sourced from [oracleselixir.com](https://oracleselixir.com/), are updated daily and reflect performance only within the current tournament — from the team’s first match to their last match in that tournament. The prediction logic dynamically uses these team stats limited to each tournament’s timeframe.
